    description: `\tWhile the ruling Nepali Congress is gearing up to decide in favour of an electoral alliance with the ruling coalition partners for the upcoming elections, top Congress leaders on Monday engaged in a heated debate on whether the party should partner with communists, especially the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre).
    \nAfter the opponents of the electoral alliance questioned the leadership that the party could face moral questions if they forged an electoral alliance with the Maoists, party president Sher Bahadur Deuba had a tough time answering them.
    \nAddressing the ongoing Central Working Committee meeting on Monday leader Shekhar Koirala, who had lost the party presidency to Deuba in the latest 14th general convention, had said Congress should not back the Maoists by ignoring its policy and principles.
    \nKoirala also warned the party leadership against foisting the headquarter’s decision on electoral alliance on the lower rungs of the party.
    \n“First we must be clear why we need an alliance,” a leader quoted Koirala as saying at the meeting. “What will happen if we impose an alliance on our local committees from the centre against their wishes?”
    \nBut party president Deuba tried to convince the leaders saying that an electoral alliance was necessary to ensure that all Congress leaders win the polls.
    \nAccording to a leader present at the meeting, Deuba had countered Koirala saying leaders need not teach him the principles of the Congress party because he had devoted his entire life serving the party.
    \n“How can I break the principles of Congress? Did I bring the Maoists [to power] or did they bring me [to power]? Why didn't you question Girija Babu earlier?” a leader quoted Deuba as telling Koirala. “How can you say that I have given the Maoists a piggyback?”
    \nDeuba also claimed that many Congress leaders including Koirala lost the last federal elections because Congress had not formed alliances with other parties and he himself had won with much difficulty so forging an alliance would benefit Congress.
    \nNot only Koirala and Deuba but the two general secretaries of the party were also sharply divided over the idea of an electoral alliance.
    \nDuring the meeting, party general secretary Gagan Thapa had opposed Deuba’s proposal saying Congress could lose its voters if the party asked them to vote for other parties.
    \nHowever, another general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who had lost to Maoist leader Ram Karki in the last federal elections, supported the idea of electoral alliance along with senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel, who was also defeated in the last federal elections from his hometown Tanahun. According to a leader, Sharma argued that alliances should be forged on a needs basis learning from the drubbing the party faced in the last elections.
    \nThose opposing an electoral alliance included party vice-president Dhanraj Gurung, joint general secretary Jeevan Pariyar, and Badri Pande among others.
    \nLeaders including Gurung had urged the party to begin a probe into corruption cases including that of the previous government instead of forging electoral alliance which he said will detract Congress voters.
    \nOn the third day of the ongoing Central Working Committee meeting, the Congress party concluded deliberations on electoral alliance among the coalition partners for the upcoming local polls scheduled for May 13.
    \nThe party, however, will come up with a formal decision in favour of electoral alliance on Tuesday, according to party insiders. They said Deuba commands a majority in the Central Working Committee so his decision will prevail.
    \n“We will decide from the meeting scheduled for 3pm tomorrow,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, spokesperson of the party. “Deliberations have concluded today.”
    \nHowever, the party is yet to finalise the nitty gritty of the electoral alliance with the coalition partners–Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist) and Janata Samajbadi Party–as most Congress leaders have said the local committees of the party should be allowed to make decisions on a needs basis.
    \nAlthough some Congress leaders speaking at the meeting viewed that electoral alliance could harm the party in the long run, most leaders spoke in favour of an alliance saying it would keep the existing coalition intact and keep the communists divided.
    \nWhile Deuba has been claiming that Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal could join hands with the main opposition CPN-UML in the elections if Congress ignored the offer for alliance, Congress dissidents say Deuba is more driven by his desire to secure his next term as prime minister than safeguard the long-term future of the party.
    \nSpeaking at the party meeting Monday, Home Minister Balkrishna Khand had revealed that the ruling coalition partners had reached an agreement for electoral alliance even before the formation of the government under Deuba’s leadership.
    \nAfter some Congress leaders including vice-president Gurung and general secretary Thapa spoke publicly against the idea of electoral alliance and Maoist Centre chair Dahal and CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Nepal subsequently demanded Deuba to come up with an official decision on the issue, Deuba had called the Central Working Committee last week.
    \nDespite some opposition against the idea of electoral alliance, the party will decide in favour, according to leaders.
    \n“On Tuesday, the party will come up with a formal decision in favour of an electoral alliance,” said Jeevan Pariyar, joint general secretary of the party. `,

    date: `${dateAndDay.month} ${dateAndDay.date}, ${dateAndDay.year}`,
    description: `\tPrime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of Nepal has reached out to the Indian side with the recent visit of a high-level delegation led by former Foreign Minister Prakash Sharan Mahat. The substantial deliverables of the visit are not known yet, but the emerging political situation is likely to throw up major challenges for Mr. Deuba that he may find easier to negotiate with India’s support.
      \nThe biggest challenge for Mr. Deuba is fast emerging from within his party, especially from vice-president of Nepali Congress (NC) and former Deputy Prime Minister Bimlendra Nidhi. Mr. Nidhi had been a solid supporter of Mr. Deuba in the past but it has been learnt that he has personally conveyed to Prime Minister Deuba that he will contest for the post of the president of the party in the convention scheduled next month. Accordingly, Mr. Nidhi has set up a separate unit for campaigning for the post in Thapa Gaon neighbourhood of Kathmandu.
      \nThe grand convention is significant as the outcome of the contest will determine the leadership under which the NC will fight next year’s election.
      \nA section of the NC led by Mr. Nidhi is restless for change as they feel that the party has not accommodated the aspiration of the younger leaders for a long time.
      \nMr. Deuba had earlier conveyed to his party colleagues that he will be willing to accommodate such demands during the 15th convention but not during the 14th that is scheduled to take place next month. But the challengers are preparing to corner him as there are murmurs within the party about the prominent role that his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, has been playing in crucial matters.
      \nIn recent weeks, Ms. Rana Deuba gained attention when she tied rakhi on visiting head of the foreign affairs cell of BJP Vijay Chauthaiwale. A senior leader said on condition of anonymity the rising profile of Ms. Rana Deuba is expected to come up during the convention.
      \nThe shadow of the challengers within the NC fell on Delhi during the visit of Mr. Mahat when he met External Affairs Minister Mr. Jaishankar and U.P. Chief Minister Adityanath. Observers had pointed out that the role of engaging India from the NC was earlier meant for Mr. Nidhi who maintains cordial ties with key figures of the Indian Government. The presence of Mr. Mahat for the same task revealed the growing fissures inside the NC.
      \nThe NC sources speculated that the real purpose of Mr. Mahat’s visit could have been to assure the Modi Government about Mr. Deuba’s pro-India sentiments to neutralise his challengers with support from New Delhi and Lucknow that can influence some of the NC leaders whose votes will matter in the convention. The NC gives special importance to the district level leaders of the party and a tight contest is expected on getting the majority of the votes from the NC leaders from all the 77 districts.

    description: `\tSher Bahadur Deuba was appointed prime minister of the country on Tuesday within a deadline set by the Supreme Court.
    \n"The president has appointed Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba as the prime minister" under the Constitution of Nepal, Bhesh Raj Adhikari, chief personal secretary to Nepali President Bidya Devi Bhandari, told Xinhua.
    \n"He will be administered the oath of office and secrecy at 6"00 p.m. today (Tuesday)," said Adhikari.
    \nIn its Monday verdict ordering the dissolved House of Representatives to be restored, the Supreme Court also directed Bhandari to appoint Deuba as the new premier by 5:00 p.m. Tuesday local time.
    \nIt is the fifth time for 75-year-old Deuba to assume the premiership. The 2017 general election in Nepal was held under his leadership. The outgoing Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli succeeded him in February 2018.
    \nDeuba will head the government until the next general election slated for November next year if he survives a vote of trust in the House of Representatives within 30 days after his appointment as prime minister.
    \nThe Supreme Court ruled on Monday that a session of the lower house of parliament shall be called in seven days.
    \nCurrently, the Nepali Congress has 61 seats in the 271-member lower house, and Deuba needs 136 votes to pass the floor test.
    \nAmong the parties and factions that had endorsed Deuba's claim to the premiership, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) has 49 seats, the Upendra Yadav faction of the Janata Samabadi Party has 12 seats, and the Rashtriya Janamorcha has one seat.
    \nWhile the Madhav Kumar Nepal faction of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) headed by Oli had supported Deuba's bid for the post of the prime minister, this faction has forged an agreement with the Oli faction to settle their disputes.
    \nAs recommended by Oli, President Bhandari dissolved the lower house on May 22 after she rejected claims by Deuba and Oli to the premiership, a move that was challenged by an alliance of the Nepali Congress and other opposition parties and factions at the Supreme Court.`,

    title: 'Congress must hold convention by September, but how?',
    name: 'Kathmandu Post',
    date: `${dateAndDay.month} ${dateAndDay.date}, ${dateAndDay.year}`,
    description: `\tThe Nepali Congress, a key political force in the country, seems to be all over the place. For more than the last three years, it faced criticism for failing to stand up to KP Sharma Oli’s poor governance and not doing enough to hold the government to account.
      \nIts credibility also came into question when it could not cobble up a coalition after Oli lost a vote of confidence in the House on May 10. President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s refusal to party President Sher Bahadur’s claim to form a new government on May 21 left a bad taste in its mouth. The party has gone to the Supreme Court to challenge Oli’s May 21 House dissolution and the President’s move of calling Deuba’s claims for the post of prime minister insufficient.
      \nThe House dissolution case is currently being examined by the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court, with the hearing set to resume on June 23.
      \nAmid this, the Congress leadership has its work cut out, and time is running out. The party has to hold its general convention by September to save itself from getting invalidated. But the country is in the midst of a pandemic.
      \nDeuba is under immense pressure, say party members.
      \n“We have called a meeting of present and former office bearers on Saturday to discuss ways to hold the party’s 14th general convention,” said Purna Bahadur Khadka, a Congress general secretary. “The meeting will make some suggestions and recommendations which will be discussed at the party’s Central Working Committee.”
      \nThe Congress held its 13th general convention in March 2016. Deuba was elected the party president in a run-off, defeating Ram Chandra Poudel, who was then acting party president. Deuba had made it to the leadership in his third attempt.
      \nAfter getting elected, he had told the Post that he would focus on ending factionalism and unifying the party. That, however, never happened. A little over a year after his election to the top post, the party lost the 2017 elections. Deuba, however, refused to step down.
      \nDeuba is now eyeing yet another term as party president. But he faces challenges from his party rivals led by Poudel.
      \nAs per the constitutional provisions and the party’s statute, the Nepali Congress needed to hold its general convention by February last year. But it did not. And then came Covid-19.
      \nThe party then decided to extend the terms and mandates of present central, district and local committees by one year as per the party’s statute, until February this year. But in February this year, it again decided to extend their terms and mandates by another six months, as per the constitutional provisions, and proposed the convention dates for August 23-26.
      \nNow there is no escaping. The party cannot cross the September deadline.
      \nObservers say it’s a shame on the part of the Nepali Congress that it failed to hold its periodic general convention, a democratic process to elect the new leadership, even though the party calls itself the champion of democracy.
      \nThat internal democracy has been on the wane in the Nepali Congress has also been scoffed by many—analysts as well as the party's well-wishers.
      \nKishore Nepal, a journalist who has a long experience of reporting and writing on almost every party in the country, says the Congress leadership has failed like never before.
      \n“The Congress leadership, including Deuba, is a desperate failure,” Nepal told the Post. “Had Deuba been ready, the party could have held its general convention.”
      \nNepal also blamed Congress members for failing to challenge Deuba and piling pressure on him.
      \n“Now, in the midst of a pandemic, the party has to hold its convention, which is a very difficult task. But the Congress is left with no other option,” said Nepal.
      \nThe Nepali Congress faced an unprecedented drubbing in the 2017 elections. It could win only in 22 constituencies—out of 165—under the first past the post system. It was because of the proportional representation system that the party had some face-saving, due to which it could have a representation of 63 members in the lower house.
      \nThe party’s arch-rival, the CPN-UML, had formed an alliance with the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) and swept the elections. Together they had 174 members in the lower house—a little shy of a two-thirds majority.
      \nDespite being the main opposition, the Congress was weak in the House. As Oli used his electoral mandate to run the country as per his wish, wilfully ignoring the rule of law, the Congress by and large remained a mute spectator.
      \nWhen Oli dissolved the House for the first time in December last year and declared snap polls, the Congress saw it as a godsend, even though it called the move unconstitutional.
      \nThe snap polls declared for April 30 and May 12 would also give Deuba a leeway not to hold the general convention. But the House was ultimately restored in February.
      \nThis time, the Congress has vehemently opposed Oli’s fresh House dissolution, also because its party president was denied the prime minister’s post. The Congress party now is hopeful of getting its president Deuba appointed prime minister after the House is restored.
      \nThe general convention, however, continues to remain a headache.
      \nRadheshyam Adhikari, a senior Congress member, says the party leadership wasted four years.
      \n“The convention could have been held last year when the pandemic had not taken hold,” Adhikari, who has overseen at least two general conventions as the head of the election committee, told the Post.
      \nThough the first coronavirus case was reported in Nepal in January last year, the virus had not spread up until February.
      \nTo hold the general convention, the party has to conclude the assemblies at various levels—ward, local (rural municipalities, municipalities, sub-metropolitan cities and metropolitan cities), district, region and province.
      \nCongress members say there is no time to conclude all these amid the pandemic.
      \nAfter the leadership’s continuous reluctance to hold the general convention, a group of youth leaders on Monday reached out to Deuba.
      \nThey demanded that the party must hold the general convention by September anyhow—by using technology if need be. They also suggested that voting be held in districts by following required safety protocols to elect the leadership there.
      \nPardip Poudel, a young Congress politician, said the youth group advised the party president to cut short some processes so as to ensure that the general convention could be held by September at any cost.
      \n“Setting up multiple booths in districts and local units so as to avoid crowding could be a way,” said Poudel. “We suggested making arrangements for representatives—those fighting for the party president, vice president, general secretary, central working committee members—so that they can vote from the district headquarters.”
      \nDeuba on Wednesday issued a statement that he is committed to holding the general convention by mid-September.
      \nOne major issue that the Nepali Congress is facing is distribution of active membership. The row over distribution of active membership is yet to be resolved. The party had earlier declared that it will distribute active membership to at least one million who are considered primary voters of the party.
      \nAccording to the party central committee, only 800,000 applications have been filed for active membership and 900,000 people have filled the forms.
      \nParty leaders believe that the delay in distribution of active membership is the key reason behind the postponement of the general convention, as active members are the primary voters who first elect office bearers at lower levels.
      \n“We missed the deadline for holding the conventions at the local level so the party needs to make a new decision,” said Khadka, the party general secretary. “The Central Working Committee of the party should review the calendar and come up with a new one now.”
      \nEven as the Congress leadership has committed to holding the general convention, uncertainty continues to loom large. Whether the House would be restored depends on the Supreme Court. Whether Deuba can become prime minister depends on the Supreme Court. Whether the Madhav Nepal faction, which had offered support to Deuba with 26 signatures for his prime ministerial claim, and which has given signatures of 23 members in Deuba’s petition at the Supreme Court, will continue to throw its weight behind Deuba is also uncertain.
      \nFor the Congress to skip the general convention in September, constitutional provisions need to be amended, and the only way to do that when the House is not there is doing it through an ordinance.
      \nAdhikari, however, said there is no point in extending the term of the present elected committees by another one year through an ordinance.
      \n“In principle, the Nepali Congress has been opposing Oli’s way of governing the country through ordinances,” said Adhikari. “How can we accept that idea?”
      \nAccording to Adhikari, if the leadership shows the will, the general convention is possible by September.
      \n“We as a party must set an example to others by following democratic processes,” said Adhikari. “We should be unwavering in our commitment to the system, constitution, democratic values and principles. General Convention is not just a technical process, it is a democratic process.”`,

    description: `\tThe ruling coalition that is contesting local elections under an alliance is holding a campaign rally in Bharatpur on Thursday. Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba along with CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and other leaders of the coalition are set to address the rally.
      \nThere are 753 local units across the country but no other municipality has received so much attention as Bharatpur given the intense debate over the selection of candidates.
      \nRenu Dahal of the Maoist Centre is seeking a second mayoral term in the metropolitan city as per an understanding among the coalition partners. But Nepali Congress’ Jagannath Poudel has decided to run as an independent against her, defying the party high command’s order. The party has even expelled him for refusing to abide by its diktat.
      \nDeuba left for Bharatpur on Wednesday itself in a move that is seen as his last-ditch attempt to convince Poudel to withdraw from the race. Last week, Deuba had sent Minister for Home Affairs Bal Krishna Khand and Umesh Shrestha, a minister of state minister at the Prime Minister’s Office, in an attempt to persuade Poudel to withdraw his candidacy and support Dahal, but to no avail.
      \nEven Maoist chair Dahal has met Poudel on more than one occasion, urging the latter to quit the race. However, Poudel has refused to budge.
      \nDeuba’s continuous push to ensure a victory for Renu, who is also the daughter of the Maoist Centre chair, has not only surprised but also annoyed Congress leaders.
      \nInsiders and analysts say both Deuba and Dahal appear to have made Bharatpur a matter of their personal prestige.
      \n“Bharatpur has become a prestige issue for the parties in the ruling alliance as the rebel candidate has complicated the election,” said Pradip Poudel, a Congress Central Working Committee member. “If the alliance candidate [Renu] happens to lose, the Congress will be blamed and that could break the coalition.”
      \nFighting elections under an alliance among the coalition partners was fiercely opposed by a section of Congress leaders. However, Deuba managed to take an institutional decision from the party in favour of the electoral alliance.
      \nDeuba and Dahal, along with Madhav Kumar Nepal, the other coalition leader, are in a bid to keep the CPN-UML in check. Deuba wants the alliance to continue until the provincial and federal elections so as to ensure his next term as prime minister but he fears Dahal could join hands with the UML if his daughter loses the polls.
      \nPolitical commentators say the way Deuba is so invested in Bharatpur to ensure Renu’s victory shows he is more concerned about himself than the party. According to them, if he cared about his party, he should have paid attention to his home district Dadeldhura as well.
      \nKarna Malla, the immediate past district president of the party, has formed an alliance with the CPN-UML in all local units in the district.
      \nSimilarly, there is a problem in Tanahun as well where Govinda Raj Joshi, a former Congress leader, has formed an alliance with the UML.
      \nBut the Congress appears least bothered about the party’s performance in home districts of at least two leaders, according to the commentators.
      \n“The Congress and Deuba are focused in Bharatpur as if there is no election elsewhere,” Puranjan Acharya, a political commentator who has a leaning towards the Congress, told the Post. “Deuba’s desperation shows he is indifferent towards the party’s problem and is only concerned that the alliance doesn’t break apart.”
      \nAccording to Acharya, Deuba fears that he will lose prime ministership if the Maoist Centre withdraws support to the government in the event of Renu Dahal losing mayorship.
      \nHe said that he has not seen Deuba investing time in emboldening his own party.
      \n“Deuba is always concerned about those whose support is essential for him to cling on to power,” he said. “In the mid-1990s, he had worked to unite the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.”
      \nAcharya added that Deuba and his party have failed to foresee the loss the party is going to suffer in Dadeldhura and Tanahun.
      \n“If Deuba was concerned about his party and constituency, he would have put efforts to settle the rebels from the two districts rather than throwing his weight behind the Maoist Centre candidate in Bharatpur,” he said.
      \nThe five parties in the ruling coalition on April 20 agreed on seat-sharing in 17 local units—six metropolitan cities and 11 sub-metropolitan cities. The mayoral candidacy for Bharatpur went to the Maoist Centre despite opposition from Congress leaders who argued that this time the Maoists should support a Congress candidate.
      \nEven some Maoist leaders are riled at the ruling alliance’s excessive focus on Bharatpur.
      \n“Dahal does not think of any other issue except Bharatpur Metropolitan City and his constituency,” said a senior Maoist Centre leader asking not to be named. “How can our party prosper when the chairman is concerned only about himself and his children?”
      \nEarlier, the coalition had scheduled mass campaigns in all seven provinces of the country and had assigned top leaders to address them but later they were all cancelled.
      \nThe Congress’ rebel candidate in Bharatpur has made the UML upbeat, as it believes its candidate stands a chance to win the mayoral post.
      \n“Since there is huge discontent in the Congress, we are pretty sure that our candidate will win,” said Surendra Pandey, a Standing Committee member of the UML, who has been leading the party’s election campaign in Bharatpur. “It seems that the Congress has sacrificed everything to help Renu win and has even gone on to take action against its own local leaders.”
      \nAccording to Pandey, the Congress cannot justify its move of suppressing its own leaders and cadres.
      \nBut leaders close to Dahal are hopeful that Poudel’s bid against Maoist Centre’s candidate may not have much effect on Renu’s prospects.
      \n“The situation in Bharatpur is getting better and it is not as bad as some people believe it to be,” said Narayan Dahal, a Maoist Centre leader who has been focusing on local polls in Chitwan.
      \nPolitical analysts say Bharatpur has now become a prestige issue for all the leaders in the five-party alliance as a win or loss there will shape the alliance’s course for the next polls.
      \n“It’s a simple equation. Renu’s defeat will send a message that an alliance between the Congress and the communists is not compatible,” said Jhalak Subedi, a political commentator who has followed left politics for decades. “The result of Bharatpur will largely affect the national politics as it could also break the existing alliance.”
      \nSome Congress leaders, however, have expressed concerns over the party leaders’ excessive focus on Bharatpur in the name of saving the alliance, saying that this could distract the party from its goals.
      \nAs the party president and senior party leaders have been focusing on Bharatpur, they fear other 752 local units may not get proper attention and the outcome may be affected.
      \n“It’s the Congress’ responsibility to convince the parties in the alliance because there is a rebel candidate against the common candidate, but the party must not get confined to a single local unit,” said Poudel, the Congress central working committee leader.`,

      \nParty President Deuba along with senior leaders of the party made the manifesto public at a press meet in Kathmandu on Sunday.
      \nIn the manifesto, the party, in addition to what it promises to do at the local level, has also mentioned what it does not want to do. The list interestingly mentions not building view towers as its priority as the CPN-UML-led government had earned notoriety for spending money on view towers that do not make any substantial difference in people’s lives.
      \nLikewise, the party says elected people’s representatives will not give jobs to any of their relatives at the local level.
      \nParty’s General Secretary Gagan Thapa, who led the manifesto drafting process, had explained the key content of the manifesto.
      \nLike the UML’s, the Nepali Congress manifesto has also discussed the achievements of the government led by the party. In particular, the party says the endorsement of the controversial MCC deal was also its achievement.`,

    description: `\tThe odds seem to be stacked in the ruling alliance’s favour, if preliminary results, which have trickled in the last two days, of Friday’s local elections are anything to go by. If the leads as of Sunday translated into victories, the Nepali Congress is set to emerge as the biggest gainer, with the CPN (Maoist Centre) managing to cling on to maintain its relevance in Nepal’s political landscape.
      \nAs of Monday morning, the Congress has won 28 local units and maintained leads in 264 while the Maoist Centre has won 21 local units and is leading in 96. The CPN-UML, which emerged as the largest party winning 294 local units in the 2017 local elections, appears set for a setback. It has won in 29 units and is leading in 165.
      \nLocal election results hold a huge significance for parties for the upcoming national elections, and it appears the ruling coalition will keep the alliance intact.
      \nExcept in 2008, when the Maoist Centre had emerged as the largest party from the Constituent Assembly elections, it has remained a third largest force. It had won 106 local units in 2017.
      \n“The alliance has definitely worked. Without the electoral alliance, the Maoist Centre would not be winning as many local units as it seems it is going to win based on the current trend,” Jhalak Subedi, a political analyst, told the Post. “And it appears set to win on its own some of the local units where there is no alliance.”
      \nAlong with the Congress and the Maoist Centre, CPN (Unified Socialist), Janata Samajbadi Party and Rastriya Janamorcha are in the electoral alliance. They have fielded their common candidates in all the positions in around one third of the 753 local units with partial partnership in the rest of the local units.
      \nBhaskar Gautam, chair at North South Collectives, an organisation focused on social and policy research, said preliminary results show the Maoist Centre got an opportunity to consolidate its strength through the alliance.
      \n“The Congress stood as the saviour of the Maoist Centre. However, the Congress is also evolving as the largest party with the support of the Maoist Centre and other parties in the alliance,” he told the Post. “The alliance has yielded positive results even though there were differences within the Congress over fighting elections under an alliance.”
      \nIt was the Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, also the prime minister, who strongly weathered criticism from his party members and firmly stood for an electoral alliance with his partners in government. The Shekhar Koirala faction in the party had been demanding that the Congress should fight elections on its own. In some places like Bharatpur Metropolitan City, the local Congress leaders had quit en masse against the party’s decision to leave the mayoral position for the Maoist Centre to save the alliance.
      \nSubedi said Pushpa Kamal Dahal, chairperson of the Maoist Centre, played an instrumental role in forming the alliance, which he knew was necessary for his party to fare better.
      \nThe Maoist Centre had formed an alliance in the first phase of local level elections in May 2017 with the Congress. Then the party decided to form a left alliance with the UML in the provincial and federal level elections held in November 2017 with the plan for a merger between the two parties.
      \nThe communists swept the elections. One of the reasons Deuba so strongly wanted an alliance was he did not want a repeat of 2017. Once bitten, twice shy.
      \nThe two communist forces merged in May 2018 to form the Nepal Communist Party (NCP). But the merger lasted only until March 2020. Dahal got his party back, but he lacked the agenda for elections. The party was facing the risk of an implosion amid dissatisfaction among members whose voice Dahal quelled with an iron fist.
      \nIn Deuba’s bid to preempt a communist alliance, Dahal saw an opportunity to stay afloat. Now preliminary results show both seem to be in a win-win situation.
      \nKhagendra Prasai, who teaches political philosophy at Nepal Open University, said the electoral alliance has always benefited partnering parties in the past and this has worked this time as well.
      \n“It is evident that the Maoist Centre would have further strengthened its position if there was an alliance across the country, and ultimately made the UML fare worse,” he told the Post.
      \nIf the current trend continues, the UML is set to lose over 50 local units against its earlier claims that it will increase its wins from the last local polls. The party, which had boasted about emerging as the largest party in the lead up to the polls, on Sunday reacted sharply, saying that the elections were rigged.
      \nIssuing a statement, the UML said the government used security agencies in its ploy to defeat the party.
      \nShankar Pokharel, the party’s general secretary, stated that the UML’s voters were deprived of voting, fake voters were allowed to vote for the parties in the alliance while there were instances where the seals in the ballot boxes were removed before they were taken to the counting centres.
      \nWhenever they sense defeat in an election, Nepali parties often tend to make blanket claims of electoral fraud. After the 2013 Constituent Assembly elections, the Maoist Centre, which was set to take a drubbing, claimed that polls were rigged.
      \nThough the UML had continuously claimed that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s decision to split from the party would have a minimal impact on the party, it appears that the CPN (Unified Socialist) did make a dent in the largest party from the last elections. It seems to have stolen some voters. But it’s a different thing altogether, according to observers, how Madhav Nepal’s Unified Socialist fares.
      \nPolitical analysts say the positive outcome of the electoral alliance would clear the path for its continuation for the provincial and federal elections.
      \n“The results have set a positive tone for the continuation of the alliance,” Gautam told the Post.
      \nIf the electoral alliance continues during general elections, the Maoist Centre stands a fighting chance of retaining its third position in the House of Representatives, which will make its chair Dahal the kingmaker again if the Congress fails to win the majority seats. Given the electoral system the country has adopted for the general elections (direct and proportional elections), a hung parliament is quietly likely.
      \n“If the political dynamics doesn’t change, there will be a situation where the government will be formed only when the Congress or the UML manages to secure the support of the Maoist Centre,” said Subedi. “It is going to be a prominent political force at least for the next five years or so.”
      \nBut how the Maoist Centre behaves could chart the country’s future political course, as its tendency to switch sides has been the source of a major ill the country has been trying to get rid of—political instability.`,

    description: `\tWhile the ruling Nepali Congress is gearing up to decide in favour of an electoral alliance with the ruling coalition partners for the upcoming elections, top Congress leaders on Monday engaged in a heated debate on whether the party should partner with communists, especially the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre).
      \nAfter the opponents of the electoral alliance questioned the leadership that the party could face moral questions if they forged an electoral alliance with the Maoists, party president Sher Bahadur Deuba had a tough time answering them.
      \nAddressing the ongoing Central Working Committee meeting on Monday leader Shekhar Koirala, who had lost the party presidency to Deuba in the latest 14th general convention, had said Congress should not back the Maoists by ignoring its policy and principles.
      \nKoirala also warned the party leadership against foisting the headquarter’s decision on electoral alliance on the lower rungs of the party.
      \n“First we must be clear why we need an alliance,” a leader quoted Koirala as saying at the meeting. “What will happen if we impose an alliance on our local committees from the centre against their wishes?”
      \nBut party president Deuba tried to convince the leaders saying that an electoral alliance was necessary to ensure that all Congress leaders win the polls.
      \nAccording to a leader present at the meeting, Deuba had countered Koirala saying leaders need not teach him the principles of the Congress party because he had devoted his entire life serving the party.
      \n“How can I break the principles of Congress? Did I bring the Maoists [to power] or did they bring me [to power]? Why didn't you question Girija Babu earlier?” a leader quoted Deuba as telling Koirala. “How can you say that I have given the Maoists a piggyback?”
      \nDeuba also claimed that many Congress leaders including Koirala lost the last federal elections because Congress had not formed alliances with other parties and he himself had won with much difficulty so forging an alliance would benefit Congress.
      \nNot only Koirala and Deuba but the two general secretaries of the party were also sharply divided over the idea of an electoral alliance.
      \nDuring the meeting, party general secretary Gagan Thapa had opposed Deuba’s proposal saying Congress could lose its voters if the party asked them to vote for other parties.
      \nHowever, another general secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma, who had lost to Maoist leader Ram Karki in the last federal elections, supported the idea of electoral alliance along with senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel, who was also defeated in the last federal elections from his hometown Tanahun. According to a leader, Sharma argued that alliances should be forged on a needs basis learning from the drubbing the party faced in the last elections.
      \nThose opposing an electoral alliance included party vice-president Dhanraj Gurung, joint general secretary Jeevan Pariyar, and Badri Pande among others.
      \nLeaders including Gurung had urged the party to begin a probe into corruption cases including that of the previous government instead of forging electoral alliance which he said will detract Congress voters.
      \nOn the third day of the ongoing Central Working Committee meeting, the Congress party concluded deliberations on electoral alliance among the coalition partners for the upcoming local polls scheduled for May 13.
      \nThe party, however, will come up with a formal decision in favour of electoral alliance on Tuesday, according to party insiders. They said Deuba commands a majority in the Central Working Committee so his decision will prevail.
      \n“We will decide from the meeting scheduled for 3pm tomorrow,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, spokesperson of the party. “Deliberations have concluded today.”
      \nHowever, the party is yet to finalise the nitty gritty of the electoral alliance with the coalition partners–Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), CPN (Unified Socialist) and Janata Samajbadi Party–as most Congress leaders have said the local committees of the party should be allowed to make decisions on a needs basis.
      \nAlthough some Congress leaders speaking at the meeting viewed that electoral alliance could harm the party in the long run, most leaders spoke in favour of an alliance saying it would keep the existing coalition intact and keep the communists divided.
      \nWhile Deuba has been claiming that Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal could join hands with the main opposition CPN-UML in the elections if Congress ignored the offer for alliance, Congress dissidents say Deuba is more driven by his desire to secure his next term as prime minister than safeguard the long-term future of the party.
      \nSpeaking at the party meeting Monday, Home Minister Balkrishna Khand had revealed that the ruling coalition partners had reached an agreement for electoral alliance even before the formation of the government under Deuba’s leadership.
      \nAfter some Congress leaders including vice-president Gurung and general secretary Thapa spoke publicly against the idea of electoral alliance and Maoist Centre chair Dahal and CPN (Unified Socialist) chair Madhav Nepal subsequently demanded Deuba to come up with an official decision on the issue, Deuba had called the Central Working Committee last week.
      \nDespite some opposition against the idea of electoral alliance, the party will decide in favour, according to leaders.
      \n“On Tuesday, the party will come up with a formal decision in favour of an electoral alliance,” said Jeevan Pariyar, joint general secretary of the party.`,

      \nThe Maoists - who formed the single largest party in the previous Constituent Assembly - have been relegated to third place.
      \nThey have complained that the results have been systematically rigged.
      \nThe vote is seen as vital in moving Nepal towards political stability after a 10-year Maoist revolt ended in 2006.
      \nFinal results in the vote - conducted through a mixture of direct voting and proportional representation - are expected over the weekend.
      \nThe previous assembly - elected in 2008 after the abolition of the monarchy - was won by the former rebels. But the Constituent Assembly (CA) was bitterly divided and failed to write a new constitution.
      \nThe Congress party has said that it may now form a government of national unity that would include the Maoists and the Communist Party of Nepal (UML) which came second in the vote.
      \nOn Thursday, the Election Commission said counting of votes under the proportional representation system had been completed. It said that the Nepali Congress party had won more than 2.4 million votes while the Maoists had won about 1.4 million votes.
      \nExperts say that the Nepali Congress has won about 200 seats in the 601-member CA while the Maoists will only get about 80 seats.
      \nThe UML has won about 175 seats, ahead of the pro-monarchy Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal and about nine parties which represent the Madeshi community in the south.
      \nOfficials said that more than 70% of the 12 million eligible Nepalese voters cast their ballots in the elections held on 19 November.
      \nThey said Nepal might have to wait for least at another two months to get a new government.
      \nThe BBC's Bhagirath Yogi in Kathmandu says that Nepal's future stability - as well as any new constitution - may well depend on the Maoists joining a national government, which is why intense negotiations are likely to take place in the next few days over the allocation of ministerial portfolios.`,

    \nWho is Deuba?

    \nDeuba also won parliamentary elections held later. He won both the Constituent Assembly elections, one from Dadeldhura and the other from Kailali. He became Prime Minister in 1996.
    \nWhen the Nepali Congress split due to internal differences,  Deuba formed the NC (Democratic) and became its chair. Before the first CA elections, the two Congress parties became one.
    \nFrom 2008 till 2012, Deuba worked as vice-president of Socialist International. Since 2013, he has been working as its Asia chapter as well as its international vice-president. He holds a MA (Political Science) and BA in Humanities as well as Law. Deuba was a research fellow at London School of Economics from 1988 to 89.
    \nIn course of movements for democracy, Deuba has spent a total of nine years in jail.
    \nDeuba got married to Arzoo Rana when he was 45. They have a son. Like Deuba, his wife is also a Member of Parliament from the NC.
    \nThe story of his rise
    \nDeuba was dear to Nepali Congress leader BP Koirala, though he did not get the opportunity to work closely with Koirala for long. BP was in jail when Deuba got into politics. After release from jail, BP went into exile in India. Deuba got the chance to work closely with BP only after the latter returned to Nepal. That was 39 years ago.
    \nHari Adhikari, an expert on Nepali Congress’ history, says, “From 2033 till 2039 BS, BP used to take Koirala with him wherever went.”
    \nIn those days, people used to accuse BP of trusting Deuba too much. And BP would respond thus: This fellow wants to learn everything, others don’t care. Due to BP, Deuba got unanimously elected as NSU president twice.
    \nDeuba had cordial relations with BP’s younger brother Girija Prasad Koirala as well. But the relations worsened after Deuba refused to engage in a conspiracy against Congress leader Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in byelections (1994), says Adhikari. In the government formed after 1991’s parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala had given Deuba, Ramchandra Poudel and Shailaja Acharya the opportunities to choose ministerial portfolios. Deuba chose Home Ministry, Ramchandra chose Local Development Ministry, whereas Shailaja chose the Agriculture Ministry.
    \nDeuba acted tough while he was in charge of the Home Ministry. Deuba acted tough against the street-based movement that the CPN-UML had launched protesting the death of UML leader Madan Bhandari in suspicious circumstances. But that tough image was gone when he became prime minister of a coalition government. At that time, Deuba emerged as a leader, who would go to any length to retain his post.
    \nDeuba initiated important projects (some of them were controversial) when he was prime minister. The controversial Mahakali Treaty materialised during his prime ministership. His government introduced a VAT regime, tried to make the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority more powerful by enacting suitble laws and declared bonded farm labourers (Kamaiyas) free. His government tried to bring underdeveloped regions, marginalised communities, women, Dalits, Janajatis and Madheshis into mainstream of national development.
    \nNational Women’s Commission, Indigenous Nationalities Commission and Dalit Commission took shape when Deuba was in the government.
    \nCritics often accuse Deuba of giving a bad name to the parliamentary system.  Horse trading in the Parliament was a controversial legacy of his prime ministership. His government’s decision to give away Pajero to all lawmakers by waiving customs came under fire. He would form jumbo cabinet to make sure that his government does not topple. This move also came under criticism.`,

    description: `\tA re-election is to be held for the post of party president at the 14th General Convention of Nepali Congress (NC) with none of the five candidates getting a majority in the first round.
      \nIncumbent party president and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba failed to get a majority in the first round and will now compete with Shekhar Koirala in the second.  
      \nDeuba was able to secure 2,258 votes. A total of 4,679 representatives cast their votes during the voting on Monday. The magical number to get elected was 2,340 and Deuba fell short by 82 votes.
      \nShekhar Koirala came second with 1,729 votes.
      \nA member of the party's Central Election Committee said preparations are being made to organize the second round of voting from 3.30 PM today. The voting will take place at three polling stations, like yesterday. Out of the total 4,743 voters, 4,679 took part in the first round of voting held on Monday.
      \nAs per the NC statute, a candidate vying for the post of president has to secure more than 50 percent of the votes cast to get elected. 
      \n Since no candidate secured more than 50 percent votes, second-round voting is being held today. The candidate securing the highest number of votes in the run-off election will be declared the winner. 
      \n The election was held for 132 party posts including the central working committee office-bearers and the members.`,

    name: 'Kathmandu Post',
    date: `${dateAndDay.month} ${dateAndDay.date}, ${dateAndDay.year}`,
    description: `\tThe two rival factions of the Nepali Congress — one led by Prime Minister and party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and the other by senior leader Ram Chandra Poudel — reached a truce on Saturday paving the way for holding the party’s local level conventions in all 6,743 wards of the country.
      \nAlthough the Deuba and Poudel factions had agreed to hold the ward-level conventions on September 3, they have been postponed to September 7 owing to lack of preparations, floods and landslides in different parts of the country, and the Covid-19 restrictions in some districts, according to a party leader.
      \nThe two factions also said they have resolved the row over the distribution of active membership, which had remained a bone of contention for months, and are set to hold the party’s 14th general convention on November 25-29 in Kathmandu amid Covid-19 pandemic.
      \nNepali Congress leaders say now the party’s entire focus is on the upcoming general convention and whether Nepali Congress will see a leadership change.
      \n“We have reached an agreement to hold the ward-level conventions on September 3 and this will ensure that the 14th general convention will be held on schedule,” said senior Nepali Congress leader Prakash Man Singh.
      \nFor the first time, the Nepali Congress has almost doubled the number of its active members. With the addition of around half a million new active members, the number has reached 8,527,11.
      \nThe party however is still silent on how to conduct the general convention in a safe setting given the pandemic.
      \n“There are concerns among the leaders and the rank and file about possible Covid-19 spread,” said another senior party leader Dr Shekhar Koirala. “We have to think about some alternatives to holding the general convention physically.”
      \nThe party has already booked the Bhrikutimandap and Rastriya Sabha Griha to hold the general convention in November.
      \nBesides thousands of elected representatives from all 77 districts, the general convention will see another hundreds of thousands of party leaders, cadres, supporters and well-wishers gathered in the capital.
      \nConvention management including making arrangements for the food and accommodation for thousands of leaders and cadres for five to six days will be a tall order for the organisers especially in the midst of a pandemic.
      \nAnd if the party, which is heading the government, violated the Covid-19 health protocols, it could have severe consequences for public health and attract a public backlash.
      \n“At the ward level, we can hold the convention physically because there will be fewer participants. If the number of voters is too big then the district elections commissions can set up two or more voting booths,” said Koirala, who himself is a medical doctor. “We can hold the conventions up to the district levels physically. For the election of central and provincial bodies, we should make voting arrangements at the respective district headquarters. It is not possible to bring people to Kathmandu in the midst of the pandemic.”
      \n“We are under pressure to prevent the party from being invalidated. So we must complete the general convention before September-end,” another senior Nepali Congress leader said. “Despite the health risks, party president Deuba has also agreed to convene ward-level conventions to avoid criticism.”
      \nDeuba, 75, who took the party reins in 2016, is eyeing yet another term.
      \nNepali Congress had conducted its 13th general convention in March 2016.
      \nAs per the party charter, the Congress must have held its general convention by March 2020, but it could not do so due to political and technical reasons including the Covid-19 pandemic.
      \nThen the party’s central committee meeting extended the terms of all elected bodies by a year. But the party could not hold the convention by March 2021.
      \nAs per the constitutional provisions, the terms and mandates of the all elected bodies were extended for six months, which means the party cannot not exceed the September deadline.
      \nThe party had earlier announced the convention for September 1-4 in Kathmandu. But due to the pandemic, the row over active membership, and factional feud made it impossible for the party to meet the deadline.
      \nThe party then postponed its convention to November, but to avoid the risk of being invalidated, it said it would start local level conventions starting September 3.
      \nBesides Deuba, party’s vice president Bimalendra Nidhi too is eying the party presidency. Nidhi on Friday inaugurated his contact office for the elections.
      \nDeuba and Nidhi are long-time friends and both have been supportive of each other in the past.
      \nSenior leader Poudel, party general secretary Shashank Koirala and leaders Dr Shekhar Koirala, Prakash Man Singh and Krishna Prasad Situala —all of them Deuba’s adversaries—too are other possible candidates for party president.
      \n“I will definitely contest, probably Nidhiji will not back down from his candidacy,” said Dr Shekhar Koirala. “We are trying to find a common candidate within our camp.”
      \nInsiders say some leaders are trying to strike a deal between three Koiralas—Shashank, Shekhar and Sujata, so as to field a consensus candidate against Deuba.
      \n“If that happens, Poudel and other leaders who are eyeing the post must back out,” a leader from the Poudel camp said. “If Deuba fails to convince Nidhi and Sitaula to withdraw their candidacies, then there will be four candidates.”
      \nA section of leaders close to Deuba is already exercising to dissuade Nidhi from contesting.
      \n“Nidhi, despite his best efforts, cannot win the elections without Deuba’s support,” Min Bishawkarma, a leader close to Deuba said, adding, “We are seeking a compromise.”
      \nMany within the party say, for Deuba, running the party would be difficult due to age factor. However, Deuba, who is currently the prime minister for the fifth time, does not seem to be in a mood to back down.
      \n“If Deuba contests for party president and Nidhi for vice-president, then the duo can easily win,” said Bishwakarma. “Deuba then can offer Nidhi the post of acting party president and assume a ceremonial role. But Sitaula too is looking for a similar arrangement.”`,
