      '\tThe ongoing Central Working Committee meeting of the Nepali Congress, which was supposed to end today, has been extended till tomorrow after the party President Sher Bahadur Deuba called off today’s meeting.\n\nThe decision to postpone today’s meeting was taken after senior NC leader Ramchandra Paudel and leader Bijaya Kumar Gachchhadar presented their opinions. \n\nThe NC president had planned to conclude the meeting today itself after taking decisions related to poor performance of the party in elections, fixing date and place for the Maha Samiti meeting, formation of statute drafting and central election committees, and announcement of campaigns to revive the party, among others.\n\nHowever, Deuba postponed the meeting in a bid to seek consensus on the resolution to be passed by the CWC, according to NC CWC member Pradip Paudel.\n\nThe camp led by senior leader Paudel has demanded that the CWC decisions should also include annulment of parliamentary board and central work execution committee ‘formed in violation of the party statute’.Leaders representing the Paudel camp are preparing to write a note of dissent if the two bodies are not scrapped.\n\nThe Paudel faction has also demanded that the gathering of the NC district presidents be held within this month, followed by Maha Samiti next month. However, the establishment faction is planning to delay the meetings.In today’s meeting, Paudel reiterated that Deuba should take the responsibility of the humiliating loss in the elections at the hands of the left alliance of the CPN-UML and the CPN-Maoist Centre. He also attributed the election loss especially to the working style of Deuba and decisions taken by his government.\n\nPaudel also said that they were not trying to remove Deuba from leadership, but they wanted change.He also defended the letter he had written to Deuba around two months ago. In the letter, Paudel had accused Deuba of being power hungry and only working in the interest of the leaders representing his camp. However, leaders close to Deuba had slammed Paudel for the ‘type of language’ used in the letter.\n\nPaudel stood firm in his stand and asked, “How many times Ganesh Man Sing became the country’s prime minister and how many times Deuba became the PM? Whom do the people admire, Deuba or Singh?” He said he had not written the letter to make it public, but the spokesperson made it public. Similarly, Gachchhadar, who merged his erstwhile Nepal Democratic Forum with the NC just before the elections, said that he and other NDF leaders should be adjusted in the party in line with the understanding reached during the merger, according to a leader present at the meeting.',

      'Deuba nixes call for Cabinet rejig to pre-empt disputes in ruling parties',
    name: 'Online Khabar',
    date: 'June 25, 2022',
    state: 'Province 3',
    description: `\tOn Sunday, when the CPN (Unified Socialist), one of the partners in the ruling coalition, suddenly decided to recall four of its ministers with a view to sending a new set of leaders to replace them, it was expected to set in motion a Cabinet reshuffle, with more changes of ministerial portfolios. However, until Sunday night, it looked like Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba might not implement the Unified Socialist’s decision immediately.
      \nOn Monday, Deuba refused to change the ministers as recommended by the Unified Socialist, in what seems to be a setback for its chair Madhav Kumar Nepal.
      \nSources say changing some ministers from the Unified Socialist would have created pressure on Deuba for a major Cabinet reshuffle, which stopped him from implementing Nepal’s decision.
      \nAnd there were concerns if changing ministers at a time when the budget is being discussed in Parliament could have sent a good message.
      \nDeuba, also the Nepali Congress president, consulted CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Madhav Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party chair Upendra Yadav on Monday morning.
      \n“We suggested that the Cabinet reshuffle be stalled for now,” said Upendra Yadav, chair of Janata Samajbadi Party. “How can ministers be changed when the budget is yet to be endorsed by Parliament?”
      \nYadav’s position against a Cabinet rejig, however, stems from pressure he is facing from some of his lawmakers for ministerial berths.
      \nSome lawmakers had already started asking Yadav to recall the ministers and send them to the Cabinet as he had earlier told them that a new set of leaders would be made ministers “after six months.”
      \nFormed in mid-July, Deuba had given full shape to his government three months later. Four ministers each from the Unified Socialist and Janata Samajbadi were appointed in the first week of October.
      \n“Our chairman had told us that the existing set of ministers would be replaced after six months,” said Pradip Yadav, one of the lawmakers of the Janata Samajbadi who is aspiring for a ministerial portfolio. “We have reminded the party chair of his words. Let’s see when he decides to replace ministers.”
      \nOn Sunday, the Unified Socialist decided to recommend Jeevan Ram Shrestha as minister for tourism, culture and civil aviation to replace Prem Ale; Metmani Chaudhary as minister for urban development to replace Ram Kumari Jhakri; Sher Bahadur Kunwar as minister for labour and employment in place of Krishna Kumar Shrestha; and Bhawani Prasad Khapung as minister for health and population to replace Birodh Khatiwada. Khapung is currently serving as state minister for health. The party also recommended Hira Chandra KC as minister of state for health and population.
      \nThe incumbent ministers, however, complained that they were not taken into confidence before the decision was taken.
      \n“Reshuffling the Cabinet when the ministers are discussing the budget in Parliament is unheard of anywhere in the world,” said Birodh Khatiwada, the minister for health and population, earlier in the afternoon. “I will be attending the Cabinet meeting later today.”
      \nAfter the decision was not implemented, Khatiwada did attend the Cabinet meeting.
      \nIt was not immediately clear why Madhav Nepal made the abrupt decision to replace his party’s ministerial line-up.
      \nSenior leader of the party Jhalanath Khanal said the leadership should take the responsibility of implementing the party’s decisions.
      \n“It’s a surprising act in Nepali politics. One of the coalition partners takes a decision and the coalition refuses to implement it,” Khanal told the Post. “Our leadership should take the responsibility and the decision must be implemented.”
      \nKhanal said the issue will be raised in the party meeting.
      \n“Our party doesn’t function along the lines of what the coalition says,” said Khanal. “Our’s is a sovereign and independent party.”
      \nMany say Deuba may have nixed Unified Socialist’s proposal to change the ministers also to offset pressure he was feeling within his party to reshuffle the Cabinet.
      \nNepali Congress general secretary and lawmaker Gagan Thapa said on Monday that there are demands within his party to induct new faces into the Cabinet although formal discussions are yet to happen.
      \n“Those who have served as ministers are demanding that they be given a chance to show their performance,” Thapa, also a former minister, told reporters after the House meeting. “It’s up to the Parliamentary Party [Deuba] leader to decide as there is a short time remaining for this government to spend in office.”
      \nThapa said lawmakers have been complaining that the same leaders are repeated every time the Congress forms the government or joins a coalition.
      \nSome Congress leaders said it’s up to Madhav Nepal how he deals with his party members after the prime minister refused to change the ministers as recommended by him.
      \n“It’s up to the leaders of the Unified Socialist; the Congress has nothing to comment on it,” said a senior Congress leader who wished to remain anonymous.
      \nNow that Unified Socialist ministers have been given continuity, a dispute is set to arise in the party, and if the problem continues, it could affect the coalition. Party chair Madhav Nepal has already expressed displeasure at the coalition after the party’s poor performance in the local polls. Another party that is not happy with the local poll performance is Janata Samajbadi.
      \nThe coalition’s fifth partner, Rastriya Janamorcha, has no share in the Deuba-led Cabinet.
      \nAs the country prepares for general elections, due later this year, Deuba is in a bid to protect the coalition so as to keep the main opposition CPN-UML in check. He fears a possible left alliance of the UML, the Maoist Centre and Unified Socialist. The Maoist Centre, which seems happy with its poll performance, does not look too keen on joining hands with the UML.
      \nSome say the dispute in the Unified Socialist, however, may trigger a new chain of events.
      \nDeuba, meanwhile, is weighing various options as he intends to conduct the general elections by November-end.
      \nAccording to coalition party leaders, Deuba and Dahal have said that the Cabinet could be reshuffled after the budget is endorsed by Parliament.
      \nDeuba is also making attempts to rope in the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party to the government by offering deputy Speaker and at least two ministers to the party.
      \nAccording to leaders, the ongoing meeting of the party’s Central Executive Committee is discussing whether to join the government.
      \n“We are ready to join the government but we need at least three ministers,” said a Central Executive Committee member of the party asking not to be named. “Why would we need the deputy Speaker’s position when the House is set to complete its term?”
      \nThe party is preparing to hand over a memorandum to the prime minister on Tuesday with a set of demands it wants to be met by the government.
      \n“We have not received any proposal from the government yet,” said Keshav Jha, a Loktantrik Samajbadi leader. “But the prime minister seems ready to address our demands.”`,

      'Congress’ shadow cabinet has largely failed to check on government activities',
    name: 'Kathmandu Post',
    date: 'June 25, 2022',
    state: 'Province 4',
    description: `\tIn order to keep a closer watch on the KP Sharma Oli administration, the primary opposition Nepali Congress had formed a “shadow government” headed by party president Sher Bahadur Deuba. But in the five months since its formation, not a single meeting of the shadow government has taken place. The role of shadow ministers has not been effective either, with little discussion over the content of proposed bills, say party insiders.
      \nMembers of the shadow cabinet themselves admit that their roles have not been as effective as envisioned and they are not working as a collective unit.
      \n“I admit that the role of the shadow government has not been effective,” said shadow minister for education Gagan Thapa. “In my case, I go through each and every issue that falls under the Ministry of Education. Similarly, I also read the bills related to the Ministry of Education, and I present myself accordingly in the House.”
      \nHowever, besides Thapa, two others from the Congress have been assigned responsibility for the Education Ministry in an attempt to balance the rival factions inside the party, said Thapa.
      \nA number of shadow ministers said that the bureaucracy hinders their work by not providing accurate information so that they can raise issues effectively in the House.
      \nOne Congress leader told the Post that most of the time, they have to rely on information from the media.
      \n“We have hardly received any support from the bureaucracy and officials from the concerned ministries that we are undersigned to look after,” the leader told the Post.
      \nAfter numerous complaints from shadow ministers about the failure to hold a meeting, Deuba is now planning to call a meeting to review the progress made by his shadow government. The date, however, has yet to be decided.
      \n“It is true that we haven’t sat together since the formation of the government, but we are regularly updating issues and voicing our concern in the House,” said shadow foreign minister Narayan Khadka. “But we have failed to expose the irregularities taking place in various ministries. There are several issues that we must raise, but we haven’t taken them up properly.”
      \nSome shadow ministers are vocal in both Houses, but the performance of others is dismal, admit party leaders.
      \nAccording to Congress leaders, the Oli government has introduced several unpopular laws related to limiting media freedoms, freedom of expression, access to social sites and the advertisement sector, but shadow communication minister Bahadur Singh Lama has yet to raise these issues in the House or make a public statement.
      \nThe concept of a shadow government came from the British parliamentary system, where opposition members are regularly assigned to ‘shadow’ ministers and assist in governance while maintaining an additional layer of checks and balances. After the formation of the current communist government, the strongest ever, the Nepali Congress had formed a shadow government and appointed ministers from all factions.
      \nSome ministers accused House Speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara of preventing them from functioning effectively as a shadow cabinet.
      \nShadow defence minister Bhimsen Das Pradhan said that Mahara fully supports the Oli government and does not accord importance to the role of the opposition party in the House.
      \n“We are collecting feedback and suggestions from various sources, but that’s not enough. The government and the House Speaker do not support us, so we’re not making progress as desired,” said Pradhan. “It is true that we have not held a meeting in five months, but we will be meeting soon.”
      \nBut experts say that if the opposition party itself is absent in the House, the shadow government can’t be expected to be visible.
      \n“If Deuba himself, the leader of the opposition, isn’t present in the House, how can we expect his ministers to play an effective role?” said political analyst Puranjan Acharya. “Has there been any significant issue that the shadow ministers have taken up in the House? There are issues from public discomfort to policy corruption, but the role of the shadow government has been found wanting.”`,

      'Thaw in Congress party allows for February 19-22 as dates for convention',
    name: 'Himalayan Times',
    date: 'June 25, 2022',
    state: 'Province 7',
    description: `\tDespite factionalism in the party leading to a fistfight between student leaders on Monday, a semblance of calm appears to have returned to the Nepali Congress.
      \nThe primary opposition Nepali Congress has long been battling internal feuds, with top leaders quarrelling over the date for the party’s general convention. These simmering resentments had trickled down to the party rank-and-file, leading to Monday afternoon’s fight over the formation of various party departments.
      \nBut later in the evening, a meeting of the party’s Central Working Committee unanimously agreed to hold the 14th General Convention on February 19-22, 2021, in Kathmandu.
      \nThe date was proposed by party President Sher Bahadur Deuba on December 28, after suspending five articles of the party charter. A rival faction led by senior leader Ramchandra Poudel had objected to the decision, saying it was taken in his absence.
      \nArjun Narsingh KC, a central member, told the Post that the party leadership has now agreed to the date that Deuba proposed, on the condition that party conventions at the province and ward levels are rescheduled.
      \nAs per the new schedule, according to KC, the ward-level conventions will be held by November 1, village and municipality level by November 3 and provincial level conventions will be completed by November 6.
      \nOn Monday evening, the Nepali Congress said in a statement that the party would complete the formation of all its interim structures by mid-February next year. Starting from mid-February, the distribution of active membership will begin and continue for two months.
     \nThe party leadership has also agreed to hold conventions in all seven provinces by mid-December so as to pave the way for the 14th General Convention on February 19-22, according to the statement.
     \nThe Congress leadership also needs to settle issues of its sister unions, like the Nepal Student Union and Tarun Dal.
     \nThe Nepal Student Union has been without its chief for the last year, after Nain Singh Mahar completed his tenure. The union’s general convention has also not been held yet.
     \nThe Nepali Congress has been facing criticism from within and outside the party for failing to settle internal disputes and play the role of an effective opposition, thereby emboldening the Nepal Communist Party government.
     \nCongress leaders said that the realisation has now dawned upon the leadership that unless the party resolves its internal disputes, it won’t be able to put a check on the government.
     \nThe leadership has come to terms with the fact that there is no future for the party unless it strengthens its internal democracy, KC said.
     \nEver since the Congress lost the 2017 elections, factionalism has grown, with party President Deuba trying to impose decisions unilaterally, say party leaders. Earlier, there were clear factions in the party, led by Deuba, Poudel and Krishna Prasad Sitaula. But after Deuba’s unilateral decision of announcing the date for the general convention, Sitaula, Shekhar Koirala, Shashank Koirala and Prakash Man Singh had all thrown their weight behind Poudel.
     \nAccording to a Congress leader, a tentative decision on burying the hatchet was reached at Friday’s meeting.
     \nAfter several rounds of talks between Deuba and Poudel on Thursday failed to yield any results, the Poudel faction said that they would hold “decisive talks” with Deuba on Friday.
     \nAccording to KC, the party is trying to resolve outstanding issues at all levels.
     \n“We hope to find common ground and resolve all the differences,” he said.`,
